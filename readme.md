# Covid GeneticAlg
Fitting a complex model of Covid-19 with Genetic Algorithms and Runge Kutta

In the folder `Covid_GeneticAlg Integer` we have the code with the case of the variables as integers

In the folder `Covid_GeneticAlg Floating` we have the code with the case of the variables as floating point variables

The explanation to run these codes is written in the inside readme's

The `plot` folder contains a small python program plotting the results

The `scipy` folder contains the simulation with scipy
