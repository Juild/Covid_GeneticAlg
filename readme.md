# Covid GeneticAlg
Fitting a complex model of Covid-19 with Genetic Algorithms and Runge Kutta

In the folder `Covid_GeneticAlg Integer` we have the code with the case of the variables as integers

In the folder `Covid_GeneticAlg Floating` we have the code with the case of the variables as floating point variables

The explanation to run these codes is written in the inside readme's

The `old/plot` folder contains a small python program plotting the results

The `old/cartesius` folder contains the simulation with scipy

The two pdf's are both the initial problem `GA-COVID-CM.pdf` and the final report with conclusions `Genetic_algorithm.pdf`
